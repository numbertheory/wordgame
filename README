# wordgame

This will serve as a framework for word games. To get around copyright violations,
the word list (src/wordlist.txt) is not found in this repository, and is ignored by git. Once you
clone down this repo, replace the placeholder file with the word
list of your choice and name it wordlist.txt.  The placeholder file does have 26 default words,
which is ok for testing but not good for games.
