# wordgame

This will serve as a framework for word games. To get around copyright violations,
the word list is not found in this repository, and is ignored by git. Once you
clone down this repo, replace the placeholder src/wordlist.txt file with the word
list of your choice.  The wordlist does have 26 default words, which is ok for testing
but not good for games.
